0,RBI's focus has been on liquidity provision in the right areas,"The outcome of the credit policy announced was certain and hence there is no surprise element. That said, the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting has been waited for two reasons. First, there was a deferment in the date of the policy ostensibly because the three independent members were not appointed. Second, the new set of members are refreshing though all are from the academia and their stance would be of interest. The minutes, which would be released later, would throw light on the discussions, which in turn, will let the market judge the proclivities of the new experts.
With inflation targeting being the rule, the relentless high levels of CPI inflation were to be the barrier to any further cut in interest rates. In fact, waiting for another two months has its merit while taking a call on rates, as the economy is also supposedly showing signs of a recovery. With inflation rate also poised to move downwards, albeit gently, due to a combination of high base effect as well as tempering of food prices, there would be more justification for doing the same in the next policy. The declining inflation rate would also justify the rate cut action in the December policy. The RBI expects inflation to ease in Q3 and Q4 of the current fiscal 2020-21 with food prices coming down.
The RBI was also expected to provide a numerical dimension to its macroeconomic forecasts. So far, the central bank has been open on the subject and while indicating a negative growth rate has not attached a number which has been now put at -9.5% with downside risk. The RBI is talking of a three-speed recovery across different sectors and has indicated that a positive rate can be seen in Q4.
Presently, the demand for funds is limited and traction has been seen more in the SME side where there is a guarantee in place. Otherwise, growth in credit has declined in other segments like non-SME corporates and retail. There is also a major restructuring exercise on, which has not yet been spelt out by banks. It will take some more time before the RBI will review the situation and take a call on lending. It may be expected that demand for funds would also increase towards the end of Q3, as firms are able to assess their spare capacity given the prevalent demand conditions.
The markets are unlikely to be moved much as this position has been factored in. As the Governor spoke, the 10-year G-Sec yield remained at 6 per cent, showing how much this has been buffered. The bond market will still be largely driven by developments on the fiscal front as it has been observed that the 10-years rate have been intransigent in the 6-6.05 per cent region. This is unlikely to change in the absence of any significant development on that end.
Three important messages given by the Governor are positive for the market. The first is the assurance that the government borrowing programmes will be managed to ensure no liquidity issues arise. Second, open market operations (OMOs) are to be announced for state development loans (SDLs), which will provide more liquidity to the market and help to temper the yields that have increased sharply over G-Secs. Third, having on-tap TLTROs for Rs 1 trillion would be largely beneficial for various sectors.
The focus of the policy, hence, has been on liquidity provision in the right areas – corporate and governments and ensure that volatility in interest rates will be tempered across different segment. This is definitely more meaningful in today’s environment and repo rate is probably of secondary importance.

1,"Financials gain post RBI policy; LIC Housing, Can Fin Homes up over 6%","Financial sector stocks including banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs) gained ground at the bourses after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced liquidity boositing measures while keeping the key rates unchanged.
In 2018, the RBI put in place a framework for co-origination of loans by banks and a category of Non Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) for lending to the priority sector, subject to certain conditions. In Friday's policy, the central bank decided to extend the scheme to all NBFCs, including HFCs, in respect of all eligible priority sector loans, and allow greater operational flexibility to the lending institutions.
That apart, in recognition of the role of the real estate sector in generating employment and economic activity, the RBI has decided to rationalise the risk weights applicable to individual housing loans, based on the size of the loan as well as the loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and link them to LTV ratios only for all new housing loans sanctioned up to March 31, 2022. The measure, according to the central bank, is expected to give a fillip to the real estate sector.
""Rationalisation of risk weights on Individual housing loans, now linked only to LTVs, for all new HL sanctioned till March 2022, is a positive for banks,"" said Amar Ambani, senior president & institutional research head at Yes Securities.

Key rates unchanged

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee on Friday voted to keep key rates unchanged and maintained an accommodative stance, announced Governor Shaktikanta Das. With this repo rate stays at 4.0 per cent while reverse repo rate stays at 3.35 per cent. The development comes amid signs of recovery in the economy badly battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
At 10:47 am; Nifty Financial Services, Nifty Bank, Nifty Private Bank and Nifty PSU Bank index were up between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). In comparison, the Nifty50 index was up 0.38 per cent at 11,880 points.
LIC Housing Finance, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services, Indiabulls Housing Finance, PNB Housing Finance, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and Repo Home Finance were up 4 per cent to 9 per cent in intra-day trade today. Bandhan Bank, ICICI Bank, AU Small Finance Bank, Bajaj Finance and HDFC Bank were up in the range of 2 per cent to 3 per cent.
“Market participants should be assured that in keeping with the monetary policy stance announced today, the RBI will maintain comfortable liquidity conditions and will conduct market operations in the form of outright and special open market operations. In response to feedback from market participants, the size of these auctions will be increased to Rs 20,000 crore. It is expected that the market participants will respond positively to this initiative,” said Shaktikanta Das in statement.
To provide impetus towards reviving the economy, certain additional measures are being announced today by RBI. These measures are intended to enhance liquidity support for financial markets; regulatory support to improve the flow of credit to specific sectors within the ambit of the norms for credit discipline; provide a boost to exports; and deepen financial inclusion and facilitate ease of doing business by upgrading payment system services.

The shares were trading above the proposed buyback price of Rs 845 per share. The stock surpassed its previous high of Rs 884.85, touched on Wednesday, October 7.
At 02:34 pm, the stock was trading 4 per cent higher at Rs 880, against a 0.75 per cent rise in the S&P BSE Sensex. A combined around 600,000 equity shares had changed hands on the counter on the NSE and BSE. In the past three months, the stock has zoomed 141 per cent as compared to a 10 per cent gain in the benchmark index.
“The board of directors of Majesco on Thursday approved the proposal to buyback up to 7.47 million equity shares, representing 25 per cent of the total paid-up equity capital of the company, as on September 30, 2020, at a price of Rs 845 a share, for an amount not exceeding Rs 631.26 crore,” Majesco said in a regulatory filing.
The buyback is proposed to be undertaken from the shareholders of the company on a proportionate basis through the tender offer route, the company said in a notice to the stock exchanges.
Majesco said the buyback of shares is subject to the shareholder and SEBI approval and is expected to be completed by December 2020.

3,Lakshmi Vilas Bank gains 16% on receiving non-binding offer from Clix Group,"Shares of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) surged 16 per cent to Rs 20.60 on the BSE on Friday after the private sector lender said that it had received an indicative non-binding offer from the Clix Group.
The offer suggests the private equity firm comprising Clix Capital Services Private Limited, Clix Finance India Private Limited and Clix Housing Finance Private Limited would be amalgamated with LVB.
“Further to the process of considering and evaluating the proposed amalgamation with Clix Capital Services Private Limited (""Clix Capital""), Clix Finance India Private Limited (""Clix Finance"") and Clix Housing Finance Private Limited (""Clix Housing"") (collectively, the ""Clix Group""), we are glad to inform that, the Bank has received an indicative non-binding offer from Clix Group,” LVB said in exchange filing.
The Bank will continue to share information on material developments as and when they materialize, it said.
The bank had received investor interest from the Clix group, comprising Clix Capital Services Private Limited, Clix Finance India Private Limited and Clix Housing Finance Private Limited, in June 2020, and the mutual due diligence was completed as of 15 September 2020.
LVB's stock had tanked 36 per cent from its recent high of Rs 24.55, touched on September 17 to Rs 15.66 on the BSE in intra-day trade on Thursday.
On Wednesday, October 7, Brickwork Ratings (BWR) downgraded the rating of the bank's long-term bonds of Rs 50.50 crore. The rating downgrade necessarily factors in the rejection of seven directors of the bank, including the interim managing director and chief executive officer of the bank, by the bank’s shareholders; the bank’s substantially weak capital position; very high levels of gross non-performing assets (NPAs) and continuous losses reported by the bank for the past 10 quarters, except Q4FY20, the rating agency said in rationale.
The proposed amalgamation is expected to address the concerns on the bank’s capital, reduce net NPAs and initiate efforts to exit the PCA required for its business growth. BWR shall also continue to monitor the bank for any restrictions by the regulator on the servicing of the coupon or debt obligations on any of its existing bond issues, and this shall remain a key rating monitorable. The bank has met its coupon servicing due on BWR-rated bonds due on 30 September 2020, and the debenture trustee has confirmed its payment, it said.
At 09:26 am, LVB was trading 13 per cent higher at Rs 20.20 on the BSE, as compared to 0.28 per cent rise in the S&P BSE Sensex. The trading volumes on the counter nearly doubled with a combined 2.24 million equity shares changing hands on the NSE and BSE, so far.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/lakshmi-vilas-bank-gains-16-as-clix-group-bids-for-private-sector-lender-120100900212_1.html
4,Larsen & Toubro up 4% after sinking 11% in 7 wks; Jefferies maintains 'Buy',"Shares of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) rallied 4 per cent to Rs 914.70 on the BSE in the intra-day trade on Friday after global brokerage Jefferies maintained 'buy' rating on the stock with a SOTP price target of Rs 1,280 per share.
In the past seven weeks, L&T had underperformed the market by falling 11.5 per cent, as compared to 6 per cent rise in the S&P BSE Sensex.
Analysts at Jefferies said an early recovery in macro investment cycle should see a sharp pick-up in the company's order flow and valuations. The Middle East (ME) margin contraction factored-in does not come through in case of better margin order flow.
""L&T's hydrocarbon segment and heavy engineering should continue to see improving margin trends. While rising share of domestic execution backed by orders picked up in the last 2 years gives margin comfort,"" the brokerage firm said in stock update.
Meanwhile, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das said today that the Indian economy will contract 9.5 per cent in fiscal 2020-21 due to disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic that has hit economic activities.
""The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for September 2020 rose to 56.8, its highest mark since January 2012, supported by acceleration in new orders and production. The services PMI for September at 49.8 remained in contraction but have risen from 41.8 in August. These expectations are also reflected in our growth projections which suggest that GDP growth may break out of contraction and turn positive by Q4,"" the governor said in a statement.
Emkay Global Financial Services, on the other hand, expect L&T to report a 3.2 per cent decline in revenues in July-September quarter (Q2FY21) as execution was impacted by labor shortage, social distancing norms and deferral by indecisive customers.
""We expect a relatively lower impact in its services business, which should offset the revenue decline. Margins and working capital are also likely to deteriorate on lower resource utilization and difficulty in receivable collection. Announced order inflows for Q2FY21 are about Rs 175 billion and we estimate Rs 27,000 crore of total order inflows during Q2, including service revenues,"" it said.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/larsen-toubro-gains-4-after-11-decline-in-seven-weeks-120100900608_1.html
5,"InterGlobe Aviation advances 5%, hits over seven-month high","Shares of InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) moved higher by 5 per cent, hitting an over seven-month high of Rs 1,393 on the BSE in intra-day trade on Friday. The stock of the airline company was trading at its highest level since February 26, 2020.
In the medium-to-long term, once the Covid-related crisis is over, the demand outlook for aviation remains very strong in India, largely driven by under-penetration, rise in the working population, and expansion of the middle class, the company said in its annual report.
Furthermore, the rise in trade and tourism is also likely to boost the industry. Based on the recent data published by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (“CAAC’”), daily flights in China have recovered by 43 per cent as of April 21, 2020, as compared to March 2020. Thus, although the Covid-19 outbreak will have a near-term negative impact, aviation in India should gradually recover and get back on track for rapid growth, IndiGo’s management said in the 2019-20 annual report.
The company said it has taken a number of actions to mitigate the impact and risks of Covid-19 to its business. These actions include cost reduction initiatives, liquidity enhancement, capacity reduction, and improvement in the fleet mix.
""We have planned a phased ramp-up of capacity in line with demand expectations going forward. Basis this, we aim to deploy around 60-70 per cent capacity in the third quarter of FY2021, on a year-over-year (YoY) basis. Given the uncertainty of the environment we will continue to monitor these plans and make adjustments on the basis of demand, as required,"" it said.
Meanwhile, in the past three months, it has outperformed the market by surging 35 per cent, as analysts upgraded the stock from 'sell' to 'buy'. In comparison, the S&P BSE Sensex was up 9.6 per cent during the same period.
Kotak Institutional Equities in September upgraded the stock from ‘sell’ to ‘buy’ and increased its fair value assessment from Rs 900 to Rs 1,520. The brokerage firm expects pressures on cost and yield to recede for the aviation sector beyond a tough FY21. ""IndiGo to re-establish its lead over peers in terms of spread, and the firm to continue driving double-digit growth for air travel for long,"" the brokerage firm said.
At 11:26 am, the stock was trading 3 per cent higher at Rs 1,367 on the BSE, against a 0.79 per cent rise in the S&P BSE Sensex. A combined 2.1 million equity shares were changing hands on the counter on the NSE and BSE.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/interglobe-aviation-advances-5-hits-over-7-month-high-120100900378_1.html

The brokerage firm's channel checks indicate strong volume growth for JK Cement in Q2FY21, as the company benefits from new capacities.
At 10:01 am, JK Cement was trading 3 per cent higher at Rs 1,638 on the BSE, as compared to 0.04 per cent rise in the S&P BSE Sensex. A combined around 149,000 equity shares were changing hands on the counter on the NSE and BSE.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/jk-cement-rallies-6-as-gujarat-unit-commences-commercial-dispatches-120100900261_1.html
7,Markets regulator clamps down on inter-scheme transfers for mutual funds,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Thursday tightened norms on inter-scheme transfers (ISTs) for mutual funds (MFs), imposing conditions on when the facility can be used and placing greater accountability on fund managers deciding on such transfers.
ISTs involve a scheme buying or selling a debt instrument from another scheme of the same fund house. The practice can create conflicts related to valuation, a matter that Sebi has flagged earlier.
ISTs for close-ended schemes will only be allowed within three business days of the new fund offer. Earlier, such transfers could be done any time as long as the average maturity profile of the scheme was maintained.

Open-ended schemes will be allowed to do ISTs only if all other avenues — use of scheme cash and cash equivalent, market borrowing, and selling securities in the market — are exhausted.
ISTs will be allowed to rebalance only on breach of regulatory limits or where duration, issuer, sector and group rebalancing are required in both the transferor and transferee schemes.
Trustees are now required to put in place a mechanism to negatively impact the performance incentives of fund managers involved in the process of ISTs in credit risk schemes, in case the security falls in default grade after ISTs within a year. Such a negative impact on performance shall mirror the existing mechanism for performance incentives of the asset management company.
ISTs of a security will not be allowed if there is negative news or alert in the mainstream media about the security. Fund managers have to provide detailed justification to trustees for buying securities that get downgraded withing four months of the IST. “The regulator’s intent is to protect investors and to ensure that funds do not resort to such transfers to hide bad papers. But in doing so, it has completely taken away the flexibility for effecting such transfers, which will now be restricted to high-grade and liquid papers alone,” said a senior fund official.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/sebi-tightens-inter-scheme-transfer-nrms-makes-fund-managers-accountable-120100801414_1.html
